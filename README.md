# Reddit Automoderator Bot
This is an automoderator code for a subreddit that sends an automatic message to users when their submission is removed. The message explains that the removal was due to the subreddit's automoderator and that the post will be approved within a day unless the moderator is on holiday. The message also invites users to contact the moderators with ideas for growing the community or to request to be a moderator, provided that they have an active reddit account with over 500 karma. The message is set to be stickied to the top of the comments section. The code also exempts moderators from receiving this automatic message.
